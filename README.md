## Coding Exercise

## Answer the following questions:
    1. Why would I use the filter function? To quickly reduce an array to the data I want.
    2. Why would I use the map function? To quickly reduce the objects inside an array to the data I want.
    3. Why would I use the reduce function? To tally my data inside an array without knowing what is inside
    beforehand.
